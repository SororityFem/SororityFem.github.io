<p>Trans Birthday<p><br>
<p>Trans peeps celebrate their birthdays in various ways. We obviously all have our birthday when we were born and many of us celebrate this. Many of us also like to mark and celebrate our coming out as our true selves as our birthday or even another birthday. Many of us also like to celebrate another birthday for when we started our medical transition and started taking our hormones. Some or all of these may or may not coincide with our birthday and we may like to celebrate one birthday on a date we choose ourselves to mark them all or to have separate birthdays to mark each milestone individually.<p><br>
<p>For us this is important because it often gives us the desired experiences of reliving our childhood, teenage years and growing into our true selves but this time around in the way that we feel is more aligned with how we should have celebrated these important milestones now living as our affirmed and correct gender.<p><br>
<p>Me and many of my social group have been celebrating our birthdays in a particular way that really makes us feel affirmed in ourselves and celebrates an important milestone in our journeys. The method we use also affirms our inner child and brings them to the front and we feel this gives us joy and is a healthy way of expressing this. What we usually do is take the typical age at which puperty begins and we use 13 as the starting point and we add the number of years we have been taking HRT thus starting our 'second' or 'real' puberty, as we often refer to it, onto that number. So for example: 13 plus 1 year on HRT would be 14, 13 plus 2 years on HRT would be 15. In this way we get to celebrate sweet 16 and sweet 17 again which is really quite beautiful. It does not matter what age you were when you started, the slate is wiped clean as it were. Happy Birthday to you all no matter what age or how or why you celebrate! x<p><br>
